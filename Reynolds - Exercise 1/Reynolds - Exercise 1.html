    <head>Reynolds - Exercise 1</head>
    <p style="color:blue">Hello! My name is Jenn Reynolds! I'm a comfy and cozy vaguely elf-like VTuber who playes video games and other content primarily on Twitch and Youtube with hopes to expand to Instagram and other social media platforms! In my free time, I play video games for fun, read books and manga, watch anime and films, collecting cookbooks and writing fanfiction. I'm a variety gamer, playing just about everything under the sun with the exception of racing and sports games. I primarily read, watch, and write things in the Sci-Fi and Fantasy genres! Collecting cookbooks allows me to explore new recipes and foods to try and eat!</p>
    <p style="color:red">I have a little experience with web design through the MART120 Creative Coding 1 class with Michael Cassens that I took a few semesters ago. My experience outside of web design is a bit limited as I only really use a little bit of coding when I'm live streaming to ensure my alerts and other things work properly.</p>
